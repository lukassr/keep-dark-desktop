***Observation:** The app is not finished yet. There are some assets with wrong colors, missing functionalities and improvements. I will accept PRs if you find an error and want to fix it* ðŸ˜Š

Special thanks to two developers who made almost all the effort. Honestly, I did a very little code here, except for some corrections of colors in the CSS.
